= Working With RDDs
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
Spark operates on resilient distributed datasets (RDDs). Higher level concepts like DataFrames and Datasets are more and more the primary means of access, but RDDs are still very useful to understand.

When you need to extract data out of Couchbase, the Couchbase Spark connector creates RDDs for you. In addition, you can also persist data to Couchbase using RDDs.

The following spark context is configured to work on the `travel-sample` bucket and can be used to follow the examples. Please configure your connectionString, username and password accordingly.

[source,scala]
----
include::example$WorkingWithRDDs.scala[tag=context,indent=0]
----

All RDD operations operate on the `SparkContext`, so the following import needs to be present before the APIs can be used:

[source,scala]
----
include::example$WorkingWithRDDs.scala[tag=import,indent=0]
----

Many arguments and return types are provided directly from the Couchbase Scala SDK (i.e. `GetResult` and `GetOptions`). This is by intention since it allows the most flexibility when interacting with the SDK. These types are not discussed in detail here, please refer to the official SDK documentation for more information.

== Creating RDDs

The following read operations are available:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| API |Description

|`couchbaseGet`
| Fetches full documents.

|`couchbaseLookupIn`
| Fetches parts of documents ("subdocument API").

|`couchbaseQuery`
| Performs a {sqlpp} query.

|`couchbaseAnalyticsQuery`
| Performs an analytics query.

|`couchbaseSearchQuery`
| Performs a search query.
|===

Writing APIs are also available on the context:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| API |Description

|`couchbaseUpsert`
| Stores documents with upsert semantics.

|`couchbaseReplace`
| Stores documents with replace semantics.

|`couchbaseInsert`
| Stores documents with insert semantics.

|`couchbaseRemove`
| Removes documents.

|`couchbaseMutateIn`
| Mutates parts of documents ("subdocument" API)

|`couchbaseQuery`
| Performs a {sqlpp} query.

|===

Note that `couchbaseQuery` is present twice, since you can execute DML statements through it as well as regular SELECTs.

The following example shows how to fetch two documents and prints their content:

[source,scala]
----
include::example$WorkingWithRDDs.scala[tag=get,indent=0]
----

Each API takes a required `Seq[T]`, where `T` depends on the operation being used. The cases classes are named the same as the operation type and allow specifying more parameters than just the document ID where needed.

As an example, for a `couchbaseReplace` the case class signature looks like this:

[source,scala]
----
case class Replace[T](id: String, content: T, cas: Long = 0)
----

So for each entry in the `Seq`, not only you can specify the id and content of the document, but also (optionally) the CAS value to perform an optimistic locking operation.

A {sqlpp} query can be performed like this:

[source,scala]
----
include::example$WorkingWithRDDs.scala[tag=query,indent=0]
----

In addition to the required parameter(s), optional information can also be passed along. Each operation allows to specify its equivalent option block (so for a `couchbaseGet` the `GetOptions` can be supplied). Also, a generic `Keyspace` can be provided which allows to override the implicit defaults from the configuration.

A Keyspace looks like this:

[source,scala]
----
case class Keyspace(
  bucket: Option[String] = None,
  scope: Option[String] = None,
  collection: Option[String] = None
)
----

And you can use it to provide a custom bucket, scope or collection on a per-operation basis.

== Persisting RDDs

While reading operations on the `SparkContext` are common, writing documents to Couchbase at the RDD level usually operates on already existing RDDs.

The following functions are available on an RDD:

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| API | Type | Description

|`couchbaseUpsert`
|`RDD[Upsert[_]]`
| Stores documents with upsert semantics.

|`couchbaseReplace`
|`RDD[Replace[_]]`
| Stores documents with replace semantics.

|`couchbaseInsert`
|`RDD[Insert[_]]`
| Stores documents with insert semantics.

|`couchbaseRemove`
|`RDD[Remove]`
| Removes documents.

|`couchbaseMutateIn`
|`RDD[MutateIn]`
| Mutates parts of documents ("subdocument" API)

|===

It is important to understand that those APIs are only available if the RDD has the correct type. The following example illustrates this.

[source,scala]
----
include::example$WorkingWithRDDs.scala[tag=upsert,indent=0]
----

It first loads two documents from the travel-sample bucket and returns a `RDD[GetResult]`. The objective is to store those two documents in the `targetBucket`.

As a next step, inside the map function, a `Upsert` case class is constructed which takes the document ID and content. This type is then passed to the `couchbaseUpsert` function which executes the operation. Note that also a custom `keyspace` is passed which overrides the default implicit one and therefore allows to write the data to a different bucket.

*Note*: If you are working with DataFrames and need to adjust the store semantics, see the section on `SaveMode Mapping` in the Spark SQL section.
