= Couchbase Cloud Support
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
Connecting to Couchbase Cloud is very similar to connecting to any Couchbase cluster over an encrypted connection. This section explains how.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must use a Spark connector version of *2.4.1 or higher*, earlier versions will not work. Also, the experimental support for Spark Streaming and Structured Streaming are not supported against Couchbase Cloud and will be addressed in a later release.

== Certificate Download

Once you have created a Cluster in Couchbase Cloud, navigate to the `Connect` tab and download the security certificate.

== Keystore Setup

The downloaded certificate is in `pem` format, so we need to convert it into a `der` format first. The `openssl` tool can be utilized for this task:

[source]
----
$ openssl x509 -outform der -in your-root-certificate.pem -out your-root-certificate.der
----

Next, the certificate needs to be imported into your java keystore with the `keytool` command. The exact arguments will vary, depending on your keystore location. In its simplest form, it looks like this:

[source]
----
$ keytool -importcert -file your-root-certificate.der
Enter keystore password:
Re-enter new password:
Owner: OU=Cloud, O=Couchbase
Issuer: OU=Cloud, O=Couchbase
... (details omitted) ...
]

Trust this certificate? [no]:  yes
Certificate was added to keystore
----

You can verify that it has been stored with `keytool -list`:

[source]
----
$ keytool -list
Enter keystore password:
Keystore type: PKCS12
Keystore provider: SUN

Your keystore contains 1 entry

mykey, 12 Nov 2020, trustedCertEntry,
Certificate fingerprint (SHA-256): **fingerprint**
----

== Spark Configuration

Now that your keystore contains the cloud certificate, through the Spark configuration properties we can instruct the SDK to enable the encrypted connection and point it to the correct keystore file:

[source,scala]
----
val spark = SparkSession
  .builder()
  .appName("CouchbaseCloudSamplpe") // your app name
  .master("local[*]") // your local or remote master node
  .config("spark.couchbase.dnsSrvEnabled", "true")
  .config("spark.couchbase.nodes", "your-endpoint.cloud.couchbase.com")
  .config("spark.couchbase.bucket.yourbucketname", "")
  .config("com.couchbase.username", "username")
  .config("com.couchbase.password", "password")
  .config("spark.ssl.enabled", "true")
  .config("spark.ssl.keyStore", "/path/to/keystore")
  .config("spark.ssl.keyStorePassword", "password")
  .getOrCreate()
----

Other than `spark.couchbase.dnsSrvEnabled` and `spark.couchbase.dnsSrvEnabled`, all other properties need to be filled with values that correspond to your environment.

After everything is configured, you can use all the APIs like you would against a regular Couchbase Server installation.
